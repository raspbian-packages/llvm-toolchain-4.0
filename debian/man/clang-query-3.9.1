.PP
clang\-query options:
.HP
\fB\-c=\fR<command>               \- Specify command to run
.HP
\fB\-extra\-arg=\fR<string>        \- Additional argument to append to the compiler command line
.HP
\fB\-extra\-arg\-before=\fR<string> \- Additional argument to prepend to the compiler command line
.HP
\fB\-f=\fR<file>                  \- Read commands from file
.HP
\fB\-p=\fR<string>                \- Build path
.PP
\fB\-p\fR <build\-path> is used to read a compile command database.
.IP
For example, it can be a CMake build directory in which a file named
compile_commands.json exists (use \fB\-DCMAKE_EXPORT_COMPILE_COMMANDS\fR=\fI\,ON\/\fR
CMake option to get this output). When no build path is specified,
a search for compile_commands.json will be attempted through all
parent paths of the first input file . See:
http://clang.llvm.org/docs/HowToSetupToolingForLLVM.html for an
example of setting up Clang Tooling on a source tree.
.PP
<source0> ... specify the paths of source files. These paths are
.IP
looked up in the compile command database. If the path of a file is
absolute, it needs to point into CMake's source tree. If the path is
relative, the current working directory needs to be in the CMake
source tree and the file must be in a subdirectory of the current
working directory. "./" prefixes in the relative files will be
automatically removed, but the rest of a relative path must be a
suffix of a path in the compile command database.

The full documentation for
.B clang-query
is maintained as a Texinfo manual.  If the
.B info
and
.B clang-query
programs are properly installed at your site, the command
.IP
.B info clang-query
.PP
should give you access to the complete manual.
