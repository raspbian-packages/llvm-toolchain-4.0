.IP
Notes:
.TP
Multiple "\-s" and "\-o" options can be provided.
They will be processed
.IP
from left to right in order, with the source files and commands
interleaved.  The same is true of the "\-S" and "\-O" options.  The before
file and after file sets can intermixed freely, the command parser will
sort them out.  The order of the file specifiers ("\-c", "\-f", etc.) is
not significant in this regard.
.IP
If you don't provide \fB\-f\fR then the first argument will be the file to be
debugged which means that 'lldb \fB\-\-\fR <filename> [<ARG1> [<ARG2>]]' also
works.  But remember to end the options with "\-\-" if any of your
arguments have a "\-" in them.

is maintained as a Texinfo manual.  If the
.B info
and
.B lldb
programs are properly installed at your site, the command
